As Kaelen screams, the world dissolves into static. He wakes up in his bed at 6:00 AM that same morning. \n\nTrapped in a time loop, Kaelen tries to save Lena, but fate seems rigged against him. Sometimes it's a sniper, sometimes a bomb, sometimes a poisoning. With each reset, Kaelen retains his memories, but so does the physical toll on his body. He discovers that the 'syndicate' isn't just a gang, but a corruption deep within his own police force. \n\nIn the final loop, Kaelen realizes the only way to save Lena is to stop playing defense. He must use the knowledge of the previous failures to orchestrate a perfect counter-attack, even if it means sacrificing his own future to break the cycle.",
