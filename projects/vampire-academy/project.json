    "synopsis": "Ren is a Dhampir—half-human, half-vampire—training at the prestigious Nocturne Academy to become a Guardian for the vampire elite. While the purebloods enjoy luxury, Ren and his kind are treated as disposable protectors. The delicate balance of the school shatters during the Midnight Gala when a student suddenly goes 'Feral,' a primal state of mindless aggression thought to be extinct. Ren discovers a shattered vial containing a synthetic blood substitute labeled with a Black Lily insignia. Before he can investigate, his charge and best friend, Princess Elara, drinks a tainted toast. With Elara's humanity slipping away by the second, Ren has only until sunrise to infiltrate the faculty's restricted apothecary, uncover the traitor manufacturing the virus, and synthesize an antidote before he is forced to execute the person he swore to protect.",
